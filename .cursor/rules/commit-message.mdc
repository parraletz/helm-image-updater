# Commit Message Linting Rules

This project enforces the following commit message rules:

- **Header length**: The commit message header must not exceed 72 characters.
- **Type**: The commit message must start with a type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.). The type must not be empty.
- **Subject**: The subject (after the type) must not be empty and must not end with a full stop (`.`).

For more details, see the [commitlint documentation](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#what-is-commitlint).
